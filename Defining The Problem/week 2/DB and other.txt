create a mySQL database to store trivia
  - have different tables and relations for questions, answers, others
  - free

create a web server on the microcontroller #rasberry pi (austin goes into detail on this)
  - create a designer independent HTTP protocol
  - would be able to access physical sensor information (temp, humidity, ambient level, etc)
  - could connect through wifi or ethernet cable
  - easy to integrate on small RAM with a microcontroller
  - already needed if we use rasberry pi

use a hypertext link (or other way) to connect to website
  - have to be careful of copyright (probably not a big deal)
  - wouldn't have to populate
