- Adding multiple clock systems (stretch goal): -
>Design a website/database to hold display data.
>Host the data on school servers OR on Raspberry Pi
>Pull data from server using microcontrollers and display it

This allows the system to be easily added to


My Notes (Don't put this into presentation):



Our main idea is to have a Raspberry Pi to host a server
or to have the school host a website on their servers.
Every other microcontroller system could pull data from the main server.
This would remove the need to add backup batteries to the slave systems,
only the main server would need a backup battery (if we choose Raspberry Pi to host our own server).
tl;dr: One expensive main system (raspberry pi?), multiple cheaper systems (arduino?).
